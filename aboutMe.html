          <p>Hi! I'm currently majoring in EECS in UC Berkeley. But I do not want
            to talk this heavy topic in my lovely pages Haha. So, let me share some my interests.
            During my spare time, I like to sing and play the guitar and the piano.
            I also like outdoor activities such as hiking, jogging, and swimming, etc.</p>

          <p>The video I attached below was made by me and my partner for the small project. Hope you enjoy it XD.</p>
